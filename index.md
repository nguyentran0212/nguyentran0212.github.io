I am a researcher at the University of Adelaide and a member of the Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technology (CREST). I study the architecture of software intensive systems that are woven in to the fabric of modern societies. My current interest is in decentralized systems, enabled by the Distributed Ledger Technology.
