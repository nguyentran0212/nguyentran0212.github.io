I deliver lectures and coordinate courses about various aspects of software engineering. I also supervise final-year, honour, and master level research projects. 

## Teaching 

### 2020

Course coordinator for [COMP-SCI-7096A](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/104082/1/sem-1/): Master of Software Engineering Project Part A. This is a major software project as approved by the Head of School. The number of units reflects the scope of the project. It is undertaken as a group project. The project will be assessed as a single entity - the student receiving this mark for all the project courses in which they enrolled.
