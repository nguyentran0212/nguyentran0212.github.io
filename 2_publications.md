### Anatomy, Concepts, and Design Space of Blockchain Networks - ICSA 2020 - March 2020

Blockchain technologies have been increasingly adopted by enterprises to increase operational efficiency and enable new business models. These enterprise blockchain applications generally run on dedicated blockchain networks due to regulations and security requirements. The design process of these networks involves many decisions and trade-offs that impact security, governance, and performance of applications that run on them. The challenge is further exacerbated by the lack of a common architecture and concept map to communicate about blockchain networks, as blockchain technologies tend to use different concepts and architecture. This paper presents a concept map, an anatomy and the principal dimensions of the design space of blockchain networks. We applied the proposed design space in a case study about designing and deploying a blockchain network for an ad-hoc IoT infrastructure. We found that the design space brought structure to the design process and the analysis of design alternatives. The presented concept map, anatomy and design space are intended to help improve the blockchain network design practice and lay a foundation for future research on the design process and deployment automation of blockchain networks.

### Internet of Things Search Engine - Communications of the ACM - July 2019

Advancements under the moniker of the Internet of Things (IoT) allow things to network and become the primary producers of data in the Internet. IoT makes the state and interactions of real-world available to Web applications and information systems with minimal latency and complexity. By enabling massive telemetry and individual addressing of "things," the IoT offers three prominent benefits: spatial and temporal traceability of individual real-world objects for thief prevention, counterfeit product detection and food safety via accessing their pedigree; enabling ambient data collection and analytics for optimizing crop planning, enabling telemedicine and assisted living; and supporting real-time reactive systems such as smart building, automatic logistics and self-driving, networked cars. Realizing these benefits requires the ability to discover and resolve queries for contents in the IoT. In this video, Nguyen Khoi Tran discusses "Internet of Things Search Engine," a Review Article in the July 2019 Communications of the ACM.
